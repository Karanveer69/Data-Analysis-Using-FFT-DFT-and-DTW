Time Series Data Analysis using FFT, DFT, and DTW

Overview -
This repository provides generalized code for analyzing time series data using various techniques, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The primary dataset consists of time series data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and the analysis methods are tailored for processing and extracting meaningful patterns and insights from the sensor data.

The project aims to provide a flexible framework for applying these time series analysis techniques to IMU data, which can be adapted for a range of different applications such as sensor data analysis, motion tracking, and anomaly detection.


Features -
1.FFT (Fast Fourier Transform): Efficient algorithm to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a time series, enabling frequency domain analysis.

2.DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform): Provides an understanding of the frequency components in the time series data.

3.DTW (Dynamic Time Warping): A method for measuring similarity between two time series that may vary in speed.

4.Generalized Code: The code is written in a modular fashion to allow for easy customization and extension for other datasets or use cases.


Installation Guide -

This section provides detailed steps for setting up your environment and installing the required libraries to run the time series analysis project.
1. Setting Up a Virtual Environment -It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects on your system. Using venv (Standard Library) create a Virtual Environment . Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory, then run:

   python3 -m venv venv

This will create a folder named venv that contains the isolated environment.

Activate the Virtual Environment

a.On Windows:

        .\venv\Scripts\activate

b.On macOS/Linux:

    source venv/bin/activate

After activation, your terminal prompt should change to indicate you're working inside the virtual environment.



2. Installing Required Libraries

Once your virtual environment is set up and activated, you need to install the required dependencies for the project.

First, download the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/Karanveer69/Data-Analysis-Using-FFT-DFT-and-DTW.git

Install the dependencies by running:

    pip install numpy matplotlib pandas dtaidistance


3. Verify Installation (Optional)

After installation is complete, you can verify that all the libraries are installed by running the following Python commands:

   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import pandas as pd
   import dtw

If no errors appear, the installation was successful.
