## Overview
This repository provides a generalized framework for analyzing time series data using various techniques, including **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**. The dataset primarily consists of **time series data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**, and the analysis methods are tailored to process and extract meaningful insights from the sensor data.

This project is designed for applications such as **sensor data analysis, motion tracking, and anomaly detection**, and can be extended for other time series datasets.

## Features

- **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform):** Computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) efficiently for frequency domain analysis.
- **DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform):** Helps in understanding the frequency components in the time series data.
- **DTW (Dynamic Time Warping):** Measures similarity between two time series, even when they vary in speed.
- **Generalized Code:** Modular and customizable for different datasets and use cases.

## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up your environment and install the required dependencies:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Karanveer69/Data-Analysis-Using-FFT-DFT-and-DTW.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
```sh
cd Data-Analysis-Using-FFT-DFT-and-DTW
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

#### Using `venv` (Standard Library):
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
```
This will create a folder named `venv` that contains the isolated environment.

#### Activate the Virtual Environment:
- **On Windows:**
  ```sh
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **On macOS/Linux:**
  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
After activation, your terminal prompt should change to indicate you're working inside the virtual environment.

### 4. Install Required Dependencies
```sh
pip install requirements.txt
```

### 5. Verify Installation (Optional)
Run the following Python commands to ensure all dependencies are installed correctly:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from dtaidistance import dtw
```
If no errors appear, the installation was successful.

## Usage

Once everything is set up, you can run the analysis scripts provided in the repository to process and analyze your time series data.

```sh
python analysis_script.py  # Replace with actual script name
```
